Motivated bioinformatician and molecular biologist, always looking for new opportunities to learn. Proud computer geek since childhood. I have always liked solving problems programmatically.

I enjoy writing code (Python, R, Bash) for my own academic and personal projects, as well as contributing to open-source projects. I’m a UNIX/Linux fanatic, and I dabble with networking, security, containerization, automation, etc.

## Higher Education

**MSc:** Genomics and Systems Biology (2018-2021) University of Gothenburg

***Thesis:** Superoxide induces a two-phased gene expression response that precedes adaptation driven by mtDNA deletions*

---

**BSc:** Molecular Biology (2015-2018) University of Gothenburg

***Thesis**: Bioinformatic analysis of members of the aquaporin family based on genome and transcriptome data from several species of barnacles*

## Recent Work

**Bioinformatician** (2020-Current) Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg

I work in Lill Mårtensson-Bopp's Group where I analyze the properties of immunoglobulins (Ig) in developing B-cells in mice. I develop and apply an R-based pipeline to analyze and visualize physicochemical and other properties of Ig sequences for publication.
